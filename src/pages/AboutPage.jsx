                <p>
                  Norivane was founded in 2014 after witnessing too many business owners leave millions on the table during their exit. Our founder, having sold his own technology company, recognized that most CEOs approach their exit without adequate preparation or strategic guidance.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  What began as informal advisory sessions with fellow entrepreneurs quickly evolved into a structured coaching methodology. Today, Norivane has guided over 45 successful exits across multiple industries, with a consistent track record of achieving valuations 25-40% above initial market estimates.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Our approach combines deep financial expertise with practical operational experience. We understand both the technical aspects of business valuation and the emotional journey of letting go of a company you've built. This holistic perspective allows us to provide guidance that addresses both the business transaction and the personal transition.

And having the skill to enhance that valuation is a gift that will keep on giving. Investors will flock to invest in your start-up. Applications for funding will pass through funding committees without question. Buyers will fight to buy your business because a business that is attractive to investors and other funders is also a business that's ready for buyers to acquire and add to their portfolios."
